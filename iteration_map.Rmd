## Excellent resources

- Jenny Bryan's [webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/thinking-inside-the-box-you-can-do-that-inside-a-data-frame/): _Thinking inside the box: you can do that inside a data frame?!_
- Jenny Bryan's [purrr tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/)

## Syntax

`purrr::map(.x, .f, ...)`

For each element of `.x`, do function `.f` with `...` parameters.

## Basic example

Now that we have a general idea of what's going on, how do we use it in practice? Let's play with the starwars dataset:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data("starwars")
starwars
```

Let's say we want to write a sentence that describes how tall each character is...

```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, hair_color) %>% 
    mutate(sentence = paste("This character has", hair_color, "hair"))
```

Great!  Works like a charm.  But notice that some of the characters have NA's for hair color because they don't have any hair.  Let's write a function to accoutn for that:

```{r}
hair_sentence <- function(hair_color) {
    if(is.na(hair_color)){
        return(paste("This character has no hair."))
    }
    
    return(paste("This character has", hair_color, "hair"))
}
```

We should be able to use this function the way we used `paste` earlier...

```{r warning=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, hair_color) %>% 
    mutate(sentence = hair_sentence(hair_color))
```

Alas, no! Something weird happened. The sentences for characters without hair didn't change. 

This is because the function wasn't properly _vectorized_, which means that you can do something to an entire vector of values at the same time. 

One way to deal with this problem is to use the `map` function. We can take the `hair_color` vector and apply the `hair_sentence` function to each of its elements:

```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, hair_color) %>% 
    mutate(sentence = map(hair_color, hair_sentence))
```

Since we didn't define an output type, it returns a list of character vectors. This is more or less what `lapply` does.

If you know the _type_ of your output, you can also specify it directly:

```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, hair_color) %>% 
    mutate(sentence = map_chr(hair_color, hair_sentence))
```

## Mapping with parameters

Now let's say you want to add a parameter to your function to capitalize the sentence for characters without hair.  

```{r}
hair_sentence <- function(hair_color, caps = FALSE) {
    if(is.na(hair_color)){
        no_hair <- paste("This character has no hair.")
        if(caps == TRUE){
            no_hair <- toupper(no_hair)
        }
        return(no_hair)
    }
    
    return(paste("This character has", hair_color, "hair"))
}
```

If we don't supply a parameter, the function will just use the defaults. If we _do_ want to use `caps = TRUE` we can do it in two ways:

1. Supply the parameter as the 3rd argument in the map function.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, hair_color) %>% 
    mutate(sentence = map_chr(hair_color, hair_sentence, caps = TRUE))
```

2. Define all parameters for the function explicitly using ~ to represent a function and `.x` to represent each element of `hair_color`.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, hair_color) %>% 
    mutate(sentence = map_chr(hair_color, 
                              ~hair_sentence(.x, caps = TRUE)))
```

Doing it this way looks weird at first, but it gives you more _flexibility_. 

For example, you can reorder the parameters and get the same result, since you're defining the parameters explicitly.

**Try it yourself:** if you wanted to write a sentence about each character's eye color, how would you do it? If their eyecolor is unknown, write a different sentence.
